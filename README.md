This is a machine learning library, made from scratch to challenge myself. No tutorials or previous
code implementation of these Ml models were used.
  

#### It implements:  
* Decision Trees - CART (which are highly performant, near sklearns implemenation)  
* Random Forests - using ensembles of these Decision Trees  
* Rotation Forests - An atypical variant of Random Forests (which allow for non-orthogonal decision boundaries)
* Sequential Neural Networks with different activations and erros
(for classification and regression tasks)

* Support Vector Machines (several variations)  
* Logistic Regression  
* Linear Regression
* A suite of useful tools for data cleaning, preparation, and visualisation
* Some toy data sets generators

#### Setup:  
Clone the repo:  
'''bash
